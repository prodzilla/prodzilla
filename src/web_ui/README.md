# Prodzilla Web UI

A lightweight and simple web interface for managing synthetic tests and monitoring.

## Overview

This web application provides developers with an intuitive way to interact with Prodzilla's synthetic testing capabilities during their daily development activities. The goal is to make testing so simple and accessible that developers are naturally encouraged to add and maintain tests over time.

## Technology Stack

- **Build Tool**: [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/) - Fast, modern build tool
- **Package Manager**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - Fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime & toolkit
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## Design Philosophy

- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and fast performance
- **Simple**: Clean, intuitive interface that doesn't get in the way

## Purpose

The UI serves as a bridge between developers and synthetic tests, making it easy to:

- View test results and status
- Trigger tests on demand
- Monitor system health

By providing a simple, accessible interface, the aim is to reduce the friction of maintaining synthetic tests and encourage developers to keep their test suites up-to-date and comprehensive.
